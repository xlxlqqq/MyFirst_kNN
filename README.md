# MyFirst_kNN
A repository about my first kNN project!

This is a repository after I finish my learning about kNN algorithm.

Note is exported from my Onenote, which is useful for my learning.

KNN.py is the main code.
Function_main has nothing, you can transfer any function in function_main.

You must add datingTestSet.txt, datingTestSet2.txt, Folder testDigits, traingDigits in the same path with KNN.py.
Or you can change the code in KNN.py to adapt to the path.
